Project Method

This REDD+ Methodology Framework document is the basic structure of a modular REDD+
methodology. It provides the generic functionality of the methodology, which frames pre-defined
modules and tools that perform a specific function. It constitutes, together with the modules and
tools it calls upon, a complete REDD+ baseline and monitoring methodology.
The modules and tools called upon in this document are applicable to:


Project activities that reduce emissions from planned (APD) and unplanned (AUDD)
deforestation



Activities that reduce emissions from forest degradation



Afforestation, reforestation and revegetation activities (ARR)



Project activities that reduce emissions from planned (APWD) and unplanned (AUWD)
wetland degradation



Wetland restoration activities (RWE)

or combinations of these.
Hereafter in this methodology and all other modules related to this methodology applied to
avoiding planned deforestation projects, where the term “planned deforestation” is used, it refers
to both planned deforestation and planned degradation.
The reference to this methodology and the modules used to construct the project-specific
methodology must be given in the project description (PD).

Sectoral Scope 14
Identification of the Most Plausible VCS-eligible Activity(ies)
To identify the type of VCS-eligible project activity, use the decision trees in Tables 1 to 3 below.
The decision trees must be used to provide a broad indication of likely baseline type and
applicability. Ultimately, the relevant baseline modules (BL-UP – avoiding unplanned
deforestation or wetland degradation; BL-PL – avoiding planned deforestation, planned
degradation, or planned wetland degradation; BL-DFW – avoiding forest degradation
(fuelwood/charcoal); BL-ARR - land suited for ARR; BL-PEAT – peatland and BL-TW – tidal
wetland) must be applied with relevant applicability conditions and criteria.
Provide all the necessary evidence to demonstrate the type of eligible activity as given in each
module.
A project can include areas subject to different eligible activities (e.g., Area A = avoiding planned
deforestation; Area B = avoiding unplanned deforestation; Area C = avoiding degradation; Area D
= reforestation; Area E = peatland rewetting and reforestation; Area F = tidal wetland restoration
and reforestation). In such cases the areas that are eligible for different categories must be
captured by different strata and clearly delineated (i.e., without spatial overlap), and the
procedures outlined below applied to each of them separately. Projects may be stand-alone
REDD, ARR and/or WRC. Projects may combine WRC with REDD, or WRC with ARR, in a single
area, in which case they must apply concomitantly the procedures for both categories provided in
this methodology, unless, in the case of stand-alone REDD or ARR on wetlands, the expected
emissions from the soil organic carbon pool or change in the soil organic carbon pool in the
project scenario is deemed de minimis, or, in the case of stand-alone RWE with presence of
vegetation, the expected emissions from the biomass pool or change in the biomass pool in
the project scenario is deemed de minimis. The tool T-SIG must be used to justify the omission
of carbon pools and emission sources.
The demonstration of eligibility must be reported in the PD.
Tables 1 and 2 below provide a decision tree for identifying the types of REDD and ARR project
activities eligible under this methodology.

If the answer is “yes”, evidence must be provided based on the application of the appropriate baseline module (BLPL for APD and BL-UP for AUDD).
4 If the answer is “yes”, evidence must be provided based on the application of Module BL-PL. Projects are required
to show legal permissibility to deforest, suitability of project area for conversion and intent to deforest.
5 If degradation is occurring through legal or sanctioned timber production this is an eligible IFM activity.

In Table 4 below, the modules and tools are listed, and it is indicated when use of modules/tools
is mandatory, optional or not applicable under each activity type.
Where REDD or ARR project activities take place in combination with WRC, the project must
adhere to both the respective project category modules and the relevant WRC modules. For
example, an AUDD project combined with AUWD on tidal wetland, must follow the instructions
provided in both respective columns.

8 The CIW category includes activities that reduce GHG emissions by avoiding degradation and/or the conversion of

wetlands that are intact or partially altered while still maintaining their natural functions, including hydrological
conditions, sediment supply, salinity characteristics, water quality and/or native plant communities.

DEFINITIONS
In addition to the definitions set out in the VCS Program document Program Definitions, the
following definitions apply to this methodology:
Baseline Period
The period of time with a fixed baseline (10 years), applicable to REDD and WRC baselines
REDD+MF - 11

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
Degraded Wetland
A wetland which has been altered by human or natural impact through the impairment of physical,
chemical and/or biological properties, and in which the alteration has resulted in a reduction of the
diversity of wetland-associated species, soil carbon and/or the complexity of other ecosystem
functions which previously existed in the wetland.
Expert Judgment
Judgment on methodological choice and choice of input data and to fill gaps in the available data,
to select data from a range of possible values or on uncertainty ranges as established in the
IPCC 2006 Good Practice Guidance. Obtaining well-informed judgments from domain experts
regarding best estimates and uncertainties of inputs to the quantification of emission reductions is
an important aspect in various procedures throughout this methodology. The guidance provided
in Chapter 2, Volume 1 (Approaches to Data Collection) must be used, in particular, Section 2.2
and Annex 2A.1 of the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
Historical Reference Period
The historical period prior to the project start date that serves as the source of data for defining
the baseline.
Organic Soil
Soil with a surface layer of material that has a sufficient depth and percentage of organic carbon
to meet thresholds set by the IPCC (Wetlands supplement) for organic soil. Where used in this
methodology, the term peat is used to refer to organic soil.
Terrestrial
On land, in the context of this methodology, though not on a wetland.
Tidal Wetland
A subset of wetlands under the influence of the wetting and drying cycles of the tides (e.g.,
marshes, seagrass meadows, tidal forested wetlands and mangroves). Sub-tidal seagrass
meadows are not subject to drying cycles, but are still included in this definition.
Tidal Wetland Restoration
Reestablishing or improving the hydrology, salinity, water quality, sediment supply and/or
vegetation in degraded or converted tidal wetlands. For the purpose of this methodology, this
definition also includes activities that create wetland ecological conditions on uplands under the
influence of sea level rise or activities that convert one wetland type to another or activities that
convert open water to wetland.

APPLICABILITY CONDITIONS

4.1

General
This REDD+ Methodology Framework is a compilation of modules and tools that together define
the project activity and necessary methodological steps. By choosing the appropriate modules, a
project-specific methodology can be constructed. The justification of the choice of modules and
why they are applicable to the proposed project activity must be given in the PD.
Specific applicability conditions exist for each module and must be met for the module to be used.
This methodology includes unplanned forest degradation caused only by extraction of wood for
fuel. No modules are included for activities to reduce emissions from forest degradation caused
by illegal harvesting of trees for timber.9
Use of this methodology is subject to the following applicability conditions, noting the project must
also comply with the applicability conditions of the applied modules and tools.

4.2

All Project Activities
All land areas registered under the CDM or under any other GHG program (both voluntary and
compliance-oriented) must be transparently reported and excluded from the project area. The
exclusion of land in the project area from any other GHG program must be monitored over time
and reported in the monitoring reports.

9

Illegal timber harvest may be occurring in the project area in the baseline but conservatively no benefit can be
calculated for preventing timber harvests, and any emissions arising from timber harvests in the project case must
be monitored and deducted from calculated project net emission reductions.

REDD+MF - 13

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14

4.3

REDD
4.3.1

All REDD Activity Types

REDD activity types are applicable under the following conditions:


Land in the project area has qualified as forest (following the definition used by VCS; in
addition, see Section 5.1.2) for at least the 10 years prior to the project start date.
Mangrove forests are excluded from any tree height requirement in a forest definition, as
they consist of (close to) 100% mangrove species, which often do not reach the same
height as other tree species, and occupy contiguous areas and their functioning as a
forest is independent of tree height.



If land within the project area is peatland or tidal wetlands and emissions from the SOC
pool are deemed significant, the relevant WRC modules (see Table 3) must be applied
alongside other relevant modules.



Baseline deforestation and forest degradation in the project area fall within one or
more of the following categories:



4.3.2



Unplanned deforestation (VCS category AUDD)



Planned deforestation/degradation (VCS category APD)



Degradation through extraction of wood for fuel (fuelwood and charcoal
production) (VCS category AUDD)

Leakage avoidance activities must not include:


Agricultural lands that are flooded to increase production (e.g., rice paddy)



Intensifying livestock production through use of feed-lots10 and/or manure
lagoons.11

Avoiding Unplanned Deforestation

Avoiding unplanned deforestation activities are applicable under the following conditions:


Baseline agents of deforestation must: (i) clear the land for tree harvesting, settlements,
crop production (agriculturalist) or ranching or aquaculture, where such clearing for crop
production or ranching or aquaculture does not amount to large scale industrial
agriculture or aquaculture activities12; (ii) have no documented and uncontested legal
right to deforest the land for these purposes; and (iii) be either residents in the reference
region for deforestation (cf. Section 5.1.2 below) or immigrants. Under any other
condition this methodology must not be used.

10 Feedlots are defined as areas in which naturally grazing animals are confined to an area which produces no feed

and are fed on stored feeds.
11 Anaerobic lagoons that function as receptacles for animal waste flushed from animal pens. Anaerobic organisms

present in the manure and the environment decompose the waste in the lagoon.
12 Small-scale / large-scale agriculture or aquaculture is to be defined and justified by the project.

REDD+MF - 14

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14


4.3.3

If, in the baseline scenario of avoiding unplanned deforestation project activities, postdeforestation land use constitutes reforestation, this methodology may not be used
Avoiding Planned Deforestation/Degradation

Avoiding planned deforestation/degradation activities are applicable under the following condition:

4.3.4

Where conversion of forest lands to a deforested condition must be legally permitted.
Avoiding Forest Degradation (Fuelwood/Charcoal)

Avoiding forest degradation activities are applicable under the following conditions:

4.4



Fuelwood collection and charcoal production must be non-renewable13 in the baseline
period.



If degradation is caused by either illegal or legal tree extraction for timber, this
methodology cannot be used.

ARR
ARR activities are applicable under the following conditions:


The project area is non-forest land or land with degraded forest.14



In strata with drained15 organic soil, ARR activities must be combined with rewetting.

ARR activities are not eligible under the following conditions:


The project scenario involves the application of nitrogen fertilizers.



If ARR activities enhance peat oxidation. Therefore, on peatland, the project must include
at least some degree of rewetting. In a tidal system where the tidal regime is restored or
continues to be in place, ARR activities are considered not to enhance peat oxidation.

Where project activities on wetlands are excluded by the applicability conditions of applied
modules or tools, such applicability conditions can be disregarded for the purpose of their use
within this methodology, as quantification procedures for peat and tidal wetland soils are provided
in Modules BL-PEAT, M-PEAT, BL-TW and M-TW. Therefore, ARR activities on wetlands are
regarded as combined ARR-RWE activities.

13 As defined in Module BL-DFW
14 Note that restoring carbon stocks in degraded and managed forest (e.g., enrichment planting) is not an eligible

activity as it falls in the category of Improved Forest Management (IFM). Restoring carbon stocks in a degraded but
unmanaged forest is an ARR activity.
15 This requirement supports mangrove reforestation in the natural habitat. ARR activities located in tidal systems
where the tidal regime is restored or continues to be in place are eligible.

WRC
4.5.1

All WRC Activity Types

WRC activities are not eligible under the following conditions:


Project activities lower the water table, unless the project converts open water to tidal
wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters.



Changes in hydrology do not result in the accumulation or maintenance of SOC stock,
noting that a) this pertains to projects that intend to sequester carbon through
sedimentation and/or vegetation development and b) this does not pertain to projects that
increase salinity to reduce CH4 emissions. Projects that aim to decrease CH4 emissions
through increased salinity must account for any changes in SOC stocks.



Hydrological connectivity of the project area with adjacent areas leads to a significant
increase in GHG emissions outside the project area.



Project activities include the burning of organic soil.



Nitrogen fertilizer(s), such as chemical fertilizer or manure, are applied in the project area
during the project crediting period.

RWE Project Activities

General
For RWE project activities, prior to the project start date, the project area must meet the following
conditions16:
a) The area is free of any land use that could be displaced outside the project area, as
demonstrated by at least one of the following, where relevant:


The project area has been abandoned for two or more years prior to the project
start date; or



Use of the project area for commercial purposes (i.e., trade) is not profitable as a
result of salinity intrusion, market forces, or other factors. In addition, timber
harvesting in the baseline scenario within the project area does not occur; or



Degradation of additional wetlands for new agricultural/aquacultural sites within
the country will not occur or is prohibited by enforced law.

OR
b) The area is under a land use that could be displaced outside the project area, although in
such case, baseline emissions from this land use must not be accounted for, and where

degradation of additional wetlands for new agricultural/aquacultural sites within the
country will not occur or is prohibited by enforced law.
OR
c) The area is under a land use that will continue at a similar or greater level of service or
production during the project crediting period (e.g., reed or hay harvesting, collection of
fuelwood, subsistence harvesting, commercial fishing).
The project proponent must demonstrate (a), (b) or (c) above, based on verifiable information
such as laws and bylaws, management plans, annual reports, annual accounts, market studies,
government studies or land use planning reports and documents.
Peatland Rewetting
This methodology is applicable to rewetting drained peatland (RDP) activities on project areas
that meet the VCS definition for peatland (see VCS Program Definitions)17.
Tidal Wetland Restoration
Project activities restoring tidal wetlands may include any of the following, or combinations of the
following:


Creating, restoring and/or managing hydrological conditions (e.g., removing tidal barriers,
improving hydrological connectivity, restoring tidal flow to wetlands or lowering water
levels on impounded wetlands)



Altering sediment supply (e.g., beneficial use of dredge material or diverting river
sediments to sediment-starved areas)



Changing salinity characteristics (e.g., restoring tidal flow to tidally-restricted areas)



Improving water quality (e.g., reducing nutrient loads leading to improved water clarity to
expand seagrass meadows, recovering tidal and other hydrologic flushing and exchange
or reducing nutrient residence time)



(Re-)introducing native plant communities (e.g., reseeding or replanting)



Improving management practice(s) (e.g., removing invasive species, reduced grazing)



In RWE-ARR project activities, the prescribed burning of herbaceous and shrub
aboveground biomass (cover burns) may occur

4.5.3

CIW Project Activities

This methodology is applicable to conservation of undrained and partially drained peatland
(CUPP) activities on project areas that meet the VCS definition for peatland (see VCS Program
Definitions).

17
RDP and CUPP project activities are both subcategories of Restoration of Wetland Ecosystems (RWE) and
Conservation of Intact Wetlands (CIW) of the Wetlands Restoration and Conservation (WRC) project category.

REDD+MF - 17

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
Project activities conserving tidal wetlands may include:


Protecting at-risk wetlands (e.g., establishing conservation easements, establishing
community supported management agreements, establishing protective government
regulations, and preventing disruption of water and/ or sediment supply to wetland areas)



Improving water management on drained wetlands



Maintaining or improving water quality for seagrass meadows



Recharging sediment to avoid drowning of coastal wetlands



Creating accommodation space for wetlands migrating with sea-level rise

Avoiding Unplanned Wetland Degradation (AUWD)
Avoiding unplanned wetland degradation activities18 are eligible under the following condition:


Baseline agents of wetland degradation (i) cause an alteration in the hydrology of the
project area (involving drainage, interrupted sediment supply, or both) and/or a loss of
soil organic carbon; (ii) have no documented and uncontested legal right to degrade the
wetland; and (iii) are either residents in the reference region for wetland degradation (see
Section 5.1.4 below) or immigrants. Under any other condition, this methodology must
not be used.

Avoiding Planned Wetland Degradation (APWD)
Avoiding planned wetland degradation activities19 are eligible under the following condition:


Geographical Boundaries
5.1.1

General

The spatial boundaries20 of a project must clearly be defined, so as to facilitate accurate
measuring, monitoring, accounting, and verifying of the project’s emissions reductions and
removals. The project activity may contain more than one discrete area of land. When describing
physical project boundaries, the following information must be provided per discrete area:


Name of the project area (e.g., compartment number, allotment number, local name);
Unique ID for each discrete parcel of land



Map(s) of the area (preferably in digital format)



Geographic coordinates of each polygon vertex along with the documentation of their
accuracy (from a geo-referenced digital map – data must be provided in the format
specified / required by the VCS)



Total land area; and



Details of landholder and user rights

The geographical boundaries of a project are fixed (ex ante) and cannot change over the
project lifetime (ex post). Where multiple baselines exist (e.g., planned deforestation, unplanned
deforestation, forest degradation, degraded land) there must be no overlap in boundaries
between areas appropriate to each of the baselines. Thus, two project types cannot occur on
the same piece of land, other than those including a WRC component (i.e., combined
REDD+WRC, ARR+WRC).
5.1.2

REDD

The boundary of the REDD activity must be clearly delineated and defined and include only land
qualifying as forest for a minimum of 10 years prior to the project start date. Mangrove forests are
excluded from any tree height requirement in a forest definition, as nearly 100% or all of their
vegetation consists of mangrove species, which often do not reach the same height as other tree
species, and they occupy contiguous areas. Ecologically, their functioning as a forest is
independent of tree height.
In REDD project activities, various kinds of boundaries must be distinguished, depending on the
REDD category (planned or unplanned deforestation, forest degradation), i.e., in case of:


Avoiding planned deforestation: project area and proxy area(s). Refer to Module BL-PL
for the detailed procedures to define these boundaries.



Avoiding unplanned deforestation: project area, reference regions for deforestation, and
leakage belt area. Refer to Module BL-UP for definitions and the detailed procedures to
define these boundaries.

20 For WRC project activities, including subtidal seagrass areas, where relevant.



Avoiding forest degradation: Refer to Module BL-DFW (for degradation due to removals
for wood fuel or charcoal) for the detailed procedures to define these boundaries.

These procedures also apply to CIW or combined REDD+CIW project activities, see Section
5.1.4.
Methods for establishing the boundaries of areas subject to leakage from activity shifting are
provided in the following modules:


For avoiding planned deforestation/degradation: Module LK-ASP



For avoiding unplanned deforestation: Module BL-UP

5.1.3

ARR

The project area must not have been not cleared of native ecosystems to create GHG
emissions reductions/removals. Such proof is not required where such clearing took place prior
to the 10-year period prior to the project start date. Areas that do not meet this requirement
must be excluded from the project area.
5.1.4

WRC

The WRC project area must meet the definition as provided in the VCS Standard: “The project
area shall meet an internationally accepted definition of wetland, such as from the IPCC,
Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, those established by law or national policy, or those with
broad agreement in the peer-reviewed scientific literature for specific countries or types of
wetlands. Common wetland types include peatland, salt marsh, tidal freshwater marsh,
mangroves, wet floodplain forests, prairie potholes and seagrass meadows.”
For RWE project activities, the project area must not have been drained or converted to create
GHG emissions reductions/removals. Such proof is not required where such draining or
conversion took place prior to 1 January 2008. Areas that do not meet this requirement must be
excluded from the project boundary.
The maximum eligible quantity of GHG emission reductions in WRC project activities is limited
to the difference between the remaining SOC stock in the project and baseline scenarios after
100 years. If a significant difference at the 100-years mark cannot be demonstrated, the project
area is not eligible for carbon crediting. The assessment must be executed ex ante using
conservative parameters. Procedures are provided in Module X-STR.
WRC project activities in tidal zones must take account of effects of sea-level rise on project
boundaries. Procedures are provided in Module X-STR.
In CIW project activities that are not combined with REDD activities, various types of boundaries
must be distinguished, depending on the CIW category (i.e., planned or unplanned wetland
degradation). For example, in the case of:



Avoiding planned wetland degradation (APWD), the project area and proxy area(s) must
be defined. Refer to Module BL-PL for the detailed procedures to define these
boundaries.



Avoiding unplanned wetland degradation (AUWD), the project area, reference regions for
wetland degradation, and leakage belt area must be defined. Refer to Module BL-UP for
definitions and the detailed procedures to define these boundaries.

Temporal Boundaries
The following temporal boundaries must be specified:
5.2.1

Start Date and End Date of the Historical Reference Period

REDD
The historical reference period is the temporal domain from which information on historical
deforestation is extracted, analyzed and projected into the future. A historical reference period
must be defined for all eligible REDD categories. The starting date of this period must be between
9 and 12 years in the past and the end date must be within two years before project start date.
WRC
While developing WRC baselines, the project must reference a period of at least 10 years in
order to model a spatial trend in drainage, and it must take into account long-term (20-year)
average climate variables, for which procedures are provided in Modules BL-PEAT and BL-TW.
5.2.2

Start Date and End Date of the Project Crediting Period

General
The project crediting period is the period of time for which GHG emission reductions or removals
generated by the project are eligible for crediting with the VCS Program. The project must have a
robust operating plan covering this period.
The project crediting period for AFOLU projects must be between 20 and 100 years. The duration
of the project activity/crediting period must be reported in the PD.
REDD
Projections of baseline emissions must be presented in the PD for the first 10-year period after
the project starting date. Emission reductions/removals can only be claimed for 10-year periods,
for which the baseline is fixed and a monitoring plan has been implemented.

REDD+MF - 21

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
WRC
Projections of baseline emissions from wetlands must be presented in the PD for the first 10-year
period after the start of the project. Emission reductions/removals can only be claimed for 10-year
periods for which the baseline is fixed and a monitoring plan has been implemented.
Peat Depletion Time (PDT) and Soil organic carbon Depletion Time (SDT)
The PDT or SDT for a stratum in the baseline scenario equals the period during which the project
can claim emission reductions from rewetting, restoration or conservation. Procedures for
determining the PDT or SDT are provided in Module X-STR.
Peat depletion may be accelerated by peat fires and is attained if the peat has disappeared or if a
stable water table inhibits further oxidation of the peat.
Since the PDT and SDT are part of the baseline assessment, they must be reassessed every 10
years.
5.2.3

Duration of the Monitoring Periods

The minimum duration of a monitoring period is one year and the maximum duration is 10 years.
Baseline projections must be annual and be available for each proposed future verification date.
Data on baseline deforestation and degradation rates, as well as on the hydrological layout and
climatic variables in wetland areas, must be presented, as well as data collected for future
baseline revision.

5.3

Carbon Pools
5.3.1

General

Any significant decreases in carbon stock in the project scenario and any significant increases in
carbon stock in the baseline scenario must be accounted for. In addition, decreases in the
baseline scenario and increases in the project scenario can be accounted for. Where ARR or
REDD activities take place on wetlands, the project must account for expected emissions from
the soil organic carbon pool or change in the soil organic carbon pool in the project scenario,
unless they are deemed de minimis. The significance of this pool may be determined by using the
tool T-SIG.
Selection of carbon pools and the appropriate justification must be presented in PD.
5.3.2

REDD

The carbon pools (and corresponding methodology modules) included in or excluded from the
boundary of REDD project activities are shown in Table 4.

REDD+MF - 22

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
Harvested wood products and dead wood must be included when they increase more or
decrease less in the baseline than in the project scenario. In all other cases, only aboveground
biomass is mandatory. If a carbon pool is included in the baseline accounting, it must also be
included in project scenario and leakage accounting.
Where the carbon pool in harvested wood products and dead wood increases more or decreases
less in the baseline case than in the project case, the tool T-SIG must be used to determine
whether significant. Insignificant pools can always be ignored.

General

The project must account for any significant increases in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),
nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) relative to the baseline that are reasonably attributable to
the project activity, with additional guidance provided in Tables 6, 7 and 8.

BASELINE SCENARIO

6.1

Determination of the Most Plausible Baseline Scenario
For each of the included project activities, the most plausible baseline scenario must be
determined using T-ADD, listed in Section 2 above. The tool has been designed for A/R CDM
project activities, but is used for this methodology by applying the notes provided for Table 10,
below.

Table 10: Translation between VCS and CDM Terminology
Where the tool refers to:

It must be understood as referring to:

A/R, afforestation, reforestation, or forestation

REDD, ARR or WRC project activity

Net greenhouse gas removals by sinks

Net greenhouse gas emission reductions

CDM

VCS

DOE

VVB

tCERs, lCERs

VCUs

Footnotes 1 and 3 included in T-ADD can be disregarded. In case there is a conflict between the
CDM tool requirements and the VCS rules, the VCS rules must be followed (as set out in VCS
AFOLU Guidance: Additional guidance for VCS Afforestation, Reforestation and Revegetation
projects using CDM Afforestation/Reforestation Methodologies, available on the VCS website).
Where project proponents use available data sourced from a jurisdictional baseline that meets the
requirements set out in the VCS JNR Requirements, those data sources may be used under this
methodology, where conservative, even where data accuracy may be less stringent than required
by this methodology.

6.2

Re-assessing the Baseline Scenario
The project baseline must be revised at the following frequencies:


For planned deforestation projects, the baseline must be revised every 10 years for
ongoing planned deforestation.



For unplanned deforestation, the project baseline must be revised every 10 years from
the project start date.



For degradation, the baseline must be revised every 10 years.



For WRC areas, the project must, for the duration of the project, reassess the baseline
every 10 years and have this validated at the same time as the subsequent verification.

REDD+MF - 28

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
The date of the next scheduled revision must be specified. The starting point for the baseline
revision of the project will be the forest cover projected to exist at the end of the baseline period.
Projections for each baseline revision will be subject to independent verification.
Reassessments must capture changes in the drivers and/or behavior of agents that cause the
change in land use and/or land management practices and changes in carbon stocks. The new
baseline scenario must be incorporated into revised estimates of baseline emissions. This
baseline reassessment must include the evaluation of the validity of proxies for GHG emissions.
For REDD and WRC project activities, ex-ante baseline projections beyond a 10-year period are
not required. For this assessment, the historic reference period is extended to include the original
reference period and all subsequent monitoring periods up to the beginning of the current
monitoring period.

ADDITIONALITY

7.1

Project method – all project activities other than tidal wetland conservation and
restoration
The latest version of the tool referenced in T-ADD must be used to identify credible alternative
land use scenarios and evaluate both the alternatives and the proposed project scenarios (see
Section 6.1) and to demonstrate the additionality of the project.
Default factors and standards used to ascertain GHG emission data and any supporting data for
demonstrating additionality must be publicly available from a recognized, credible source, such as
IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories or the IPCC 2003 Good Practice Guidelines
for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry.

QUANTIFICATION OF GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND REMOVALS

8.1

Baseline Emissions
8.1.1

General

Each activity type included in the project must estimate an individual baseline following the
provisions and specific modules mentioned below. Combined activities (i.e., ARR or REDD with a
WRC component) must develop a unique baseline considering peat or tidal wetland soils as the
REDD+MF - 29

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
SOC pool and incorporating the resulting emission estimates to the calculation of emissions and
carbon stock changes of the ARR and/or REDD activities.
The same procedure must be followed ex ante and ex post. For parameters that will be monitored
subsequent to project initiation, guidance is given in the parameter tables of the relevant modules
for the values that must be used in ex-ante calculations.
8.1.2

REDD

The baseline of the REDD project activity is estimated ex ante. It can be monitored in a reference
area (unplanned deforestation) or proxy area (planned deforestation) for the purpose of
periodically adjusting the baseline. Ex-ante baseline estimations are therefore used in both the
ex-ante and ex-post estimation of net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emission
reductions.
Methods for estimating net baseline carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions are
provided in the following modules:


For planned deforestation/degradation: Module BL-PL



For unplanned deforestation: Module BL-UP



For forest degradation from extraction of wood for fuel: Module BL-DFW

8.1.3

ARR

The net GHG removals in the baseline scenario must be estimated using Module BL-ARR.
8.1.4

WRC

Baseline net emissions from the SOC pool must be estimated using Module BL-PEAT or BL-TW,
whichever is relevant (see Table 3). For peat strata within tidal wetlands, Module BL-PEAT must
be used.
Socio-economic processes causing the degradation of wetlands are similar to those causing
deforestation or forest degradation. Therefore, for stand-alone CIW project activities (e.g.,
conservation of salt marshes without a tree biomass component), similar methods for baseline
determination can be used as for REDD project activities. Stand-alone CIW as well as CIWREDD project activities use Module BL-TW or BL-PEAT (whichever is relevant) in conjunction
with Module BL-UP or BL-PL (whichever is relevant).
Stand-alone RWE and RWE-ARR project activities must use Module BL-PEAT or BL-TW
(whichever is relevant) for baseline net GHG emissions from the SOC pool. In case fossil fuel
combustion is accounted for, Module E-FFC must be used as well. RWE-ARR project activities

Project Emissions
8.2.1

General

The same procedure must be followed ex ante and ex post. For parameters that will be monitored
subsequent to project initiation, guidance is given in the parameter tables of the relevant modules
for the values that must be used in ex-ante calculations.
8.2.2

REDD

Methods for estimating net carbon stock changes and GHG emissions in the project scenario are
provided in Module M-REDD.
8.2.3

ARR

The net GHG removals in the project scenario must be estimated using Module M-ARR.
8.2.4

WRC

Net GHG emissions from the SOC pool in the project scenario must be estimated using Module
M-PEAT or M-TW (whichever is relevant). For peat strata within tidal wetlands, Module M-PEAT
must be used.
Stand-alone CIW and CIW-REDD project activities must use Module M-TW or M-PEAT
(whichever is relevant) for the estimation of project net emissions from the SOC pool, and
Module M-REDD for all other pools and emissions (where relevant).
Stand-alone RWE and RWE-ARR project activities must use Module M-PEAT or M-TW
(whichever is relevant) for project net GHG emissions from the SOC pool. Where fossil fuel
combustion is accounted for, Module E-FFC must be used as well. RWE-ARR project activities
must also use Module M-ARR for the accounting of biomass and biomass burning (where
relevant). RWE-REDD project activities must use Module M-PEAT or M-TW (whichever is
relevant) for the estimation of project net emissions from the SOC pool, and Module M-REDD for
all other pools and emissions.

8.3

Leakage
Leakage must be considered for all activities, using the following leakage modules:


For planned deforestation/degradation and planned wetland degradation: Module LKASP



For unplanned deforestation and unplanned wetland degradation: Module LK-ASU



For fuel-wood/charcoal collection: Module LK-DFW



For pre-project agricultural or aquacultural activities: Module LK-ARR



For WRC project activities: Module LK-ECO

REDD+MF - 31

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
For stand-alone CIW project activities, similar methods for leakage determination can be used
as for REDD project activities, and Module LK-ASU, LK-ASP or LK-ME (whichever is relevant)
must be used.
Combined RWE-ARR projects must use Module LK-ASP.
The significance of leakage and the significance of carbon pools may be determined using T-SIG.
Where applicable, leakage due to market effects must be considered using Module LK-ME.
Market effects must be considered where the project leads to a decrease in the production of
timber, fuelwood, or charcoal.
Where, pre-project, unsustainable fuelwood collection is occurring within the project boundary,
Modules BL-DFW and LK-DFW must be used to determine potential leakage.
Where leakage prevention activities include tree planting, aquacultural intensification, agricultural
intensification, fertilization, fodder production, other measures to enhance cropland and/or
grazing land areas, leakage management zones or a combination of these, then any significant
increase in GHG emissions associated with these activities must be accounted for, unless
deemed de minimis, as determined using T-SIG.
Leakage prevention activities may lead to the increase in combustion of fossil fuels; however, any
increase in emissions is considered insignificant.
Where leakage prevention leads to a significant increase in the use of fertilizers, Module E-NA
must be used. T-SIG can be used to determine significance.
As per the applicability conditions, leakage prevention may not include the flooding of agricultural
lands (e.g., for new rice paddies) nor the creation of livestock feedlots and/or manure lagoons.
Leakage prevention may also not include the drainage of peatland.
The list of leakage sources with appropriate justification must be presented.
Positive leakage may not be accounted for.

8.4.5

Calculation of AFOLU Pooled Buffer Account Contribution

The number of credits to be held in the AFOLU pooled buffer account is determined as a
percentage of the total carbon stock benefits. For REDD project activities, this is equal to the net
emissions in the baseline minus emissions from fossil fuel use and fertilizer use minus the net
emissions in the project case minus emissions from fossil fuels and fertilizer use. Leakage
emissions do not factor into the buffer calculations.
For REDD projects, the calculation of the net change in carbon stocks applied in this
methodology includes an adjustment for emissions from fossil fuel combustion and direct N2O
emissions and excludes emissions from biomass burning. Besides other GHG fluxes, biomass
burning involves a carbon stock change. The procedure, therefore, provides a conservative
(larger) estimate of the buffer withholding.
For WRC project activities, the proxy for the net change in carbon stocks applied in this
methodology is NERWRC. As this proxy includes all net GHG emissions reductions, it provides a
conservative (larger) estimate of the buffer.
Since GHG emission reductions from ARR are unlikely to differ greatly from the net change in
carbon stocks, the proxy for the net change in carbon stocks applied in this methodology is
NGRARR. As this proxy includes all GHG emissions reductions and removals, it provides a
conservative (larger) estimate of the buffer withholding.

Uncertainty Analysis

Project must use Module X-UNC to combine uncertainty information and conservative estimates
and produce an overall uncertainty estimate of the total net GHG emission reductions. The
estimated cumulative net anthropogenic GHG emission reductions must be adjusted at each
point in time to account for uncertainty as indicated in Module X-UNC25. Module X-UNC
calculates an adjusted value for NERREDD+ for any point in time. This adjusted Adjusted_NERREDD+
must be the basis of calculations at each point in time in Equation 19.
8.4.7

Calculation of Verified Carbon Units

To estimate the number of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) for the monitoring period T = t2-t1, this





VCUt  Adjusted _ NERREDD,t 2  Adjusted _ NERREDD,t1  BufferTotal

(19)

Where:
VCUt

Number of Verified Carbon Units at year t = t2 - t1 (VCU)

Adjusted_NERREDD+,t2

Total net GHG emission reductions of the REDD+ project activity up to
year t2 and adjusted to account for uncertainty (t CO2e)

Adjusted_NERREDD+,t1

Total net GHG emission reductions of the REDD+ project activity up to
year t1 and adjusted to account for uncertainty (t CO2e)

24 Buffer withholding percentages are based on the project’s overall risk classification, the percentage of carbon

credits generated by the approved project activity that must be deposited into the AFOLU pooled buffer account to
cover non-permanence related project risks. Buffer withholding percentage must be calculated using T-BAR.
Different percentages will likely be calculated for each of the baseline types as relevant.
25 The allowable uncertainty under this methodology is +/- 15% of NER
REDD+ at the 95% confidence level. Where this
precision level is met then no deduction should result for uncertainty. Where uncertainty exceeds 15% of NERREDD+
at the 95% confidence level then the deduction must be equal to the amount that the uncertainty exceeds the
allowable level.

Description of the Monitoring Plan
9.3.1

Development of Monitoring Plan

General
The monitoring plan must address the following monitoring tasks, which must be included in the
monitoring plan:


Monitoring of project implementation



Monitoring of actual carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions



Monitoring of leakage carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions



Estimation of ex post net carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions

For each of these tasks, the monitoring plan must include the following information:
a. Technical description of the monitoring task
b. Data to be collected (the list of data and parameters to be collected must be given in PD)
c.

Overview of data collection procedures

d. Quality control and quality assurance procedure
e. Data archiving
f.

Organisation and responsibilities of the parties involved in all of the above

Uncertainty and Quality Management
Quality management procedures are required for the management of data and information,
including the assessment of uncertainty, relevant to the project and baseline scenarios. As far as
is practical, uncertainties related to the quantification of GHG emission reductions and removals
by sinks should be reduced.
To help reduce uncertainties in the accounting of emissions and removals, this methodology
uses, whenever possible, the proven methods from the latest available IPCC guidance
documents (GPG-LULUCF and Reporting Guidelines) and peer-reviewed literature. Despite this,
potential uncertainties still arise from the choice of parameters to be used. Uncertainties arising
from input parameters would result in uncertainties in the estimation of both baseline net GHG
emissions and project net GHG emissions – especially when global default factors are used. The
project must identify key parameters that would significantly influence the accuracy of estimates.
Local values that are specific to the project circumstances must then be obtained for these key
parameters, whenever possible. These values should be based on:

REDD+MF - 48

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14


Data from well-referenced peer-reviewed literature or other well-established published
sources26; or



National inventory data or default factors from IPCC literature that has, whenever
possible and necessary, been checked for consistency against available local data
specific to the project circumstances; or



In the absence of the above sources of information, expert opinion may be used to assist
with data selection. Experts will often provide a range of data, as well as a most probable
value for the data. The rationale for selecting a particular data value must be briefly
noted.

In choosing key parameters, or making important assumptions based on information that is not
specific to the project circumstances, such as in use of default factors, the project must select
values that will lead to an accurate estimation of net GHG emission reductions, taking into
account uncertainties.
If uncertainty is significant, the project must choose data such that it indisputably tends to underestimate, rather than over-estimate, net GHG project benefits.
To ensure that GHG fluxes are estimated in a way that is accurate, verifiable, transparent, and
consistent across measurement periods, the project must establish and document clear standard
operating procedures and procedures for ensuring data quality. At a minimum, these procedures
must include:


Comprehensive documentation of all field measurements carried out in the project area.
This document must be detailed enough to allow replication of sampling in the event of
staff turnover between monitoring periods



Training procedures for all persons involved in field measurement or data analysis. The
scope and date of all training must be documented



A protocol for assessing the accuracy of plot measurements using a check cruise and a
plan for correcting the inventory if errors are discovered



Protocols for assessing data for outliers, transcription errors, and consistency across
measurement periods



Data sheets must be safely archived for the life of the project. Data stored in electronic
formats must be backed up

Expert judgement
The use of expert judgment for the selection and interpretation of methods, selection of input data
to fill gaps in available data, and selection of data from a range of possible values or uncertainty
26 Typically, citations for sources of data used should include: the report or paper title, publisher, page numbers,

publication date etc. (or a detailed web address). If web-based reports are cited, hardcopies should be included as
annexes in the PD if there is any likelihood that such reports may not be permanently available.

ranges, are all well established in the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance. Obtaining wellinformed judgments from domain experts regarding best estimates and uncertainties is an
important aspect in various procedures throughout this methodology. The project proponent must
use the guidance provided in Chapter 2 (Approaches to Data Collection), in particular, Section 2.2
and Annex 2A.1 of the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance.
Monitoring of Project Implementation
Information must be provided, and recorded, to establish that:
1) The geographic position of the project boundary is recorded for all areas of land. The
geographic coordinates of the project boundary (and any stratification or buffer zones
inside the boundary) are established, recorded and archived. This can be achieved by
field survey (eg, using GPS), or by using georeferenced spatial data (eg, maps, GIS
datasets, orthorectified aerial photography or georeferenced remote sensing images).
The above also applies to the recording of strata, including strata resulting from peatland
fires in the project scenario.
2) Commonly accepted principles of land use inventory and management are implemented.


Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and quality control/quality assurance
(QA/QC) procedures for inventories including field data collection and data
management must be applied. Use or adaptation of SOPs already applied in national
land use monitoring, or available from published handbooks, or from the latest IPCC
guidance documents (GPG–LULUCF, Reporting Guidelines, is recommended



Apply SOPs, especially for actions likely to cause peat disturbances



The project plan, together with a record of the plan as actually implemented during
the project must be available for validation or verification, as appropriate

For WRC project activities, continued compliance with the applicability conditions of this
methodology must be ensured by monitoring that:


The water table is not lowered except where the project converts open water to tidal
wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters



The burning of organic soil as a project activity does not occur



Peatland fires within the project area do not occur in the project scenario. If they do
occur as non-catastrophic events, they are accounted for by cancelling the Fire
Reduction Premium for the entire project or the individual project activity instance.



Nitrogen fertilizers are not used within the project area in the project scenario

Monitoring

Ex-post monitoring must have two key aspects:
TASK 1. Monitoring according to monitoring plan
TASK 2. Revising the baseline for future project crediting periods
TASK 1: Monitoring According to the Monitoring Plan
Monitoring of Key Baseline Variables
REDD
Information required to periodically reassess the project baseline must be collected during the
entire project crediting period. Key variables to be measured are:


Changes in forest cover in the Reference Regions for Deforestation (RRD) (at a minimum
of every 10 years), as specified in Module M-REDD and where relevant in Module BLUP.



Spatial variable datasets used to model the location of deforestation, as specified in
Module BL-UP. As a minimum, the variables used in the first baseline assessment must
be monitored at the time of the re-assessment to determine if they have changed.



Where required, carbon stock data, as specified in Module M-REDD.

REDD+MF - 51

VM0007, Version 1.6
Sectoral Scope 14
ARR
Changes in biomass carbon stocks in the project area must be measured before each verification
as part of the monitoring. Methods must be consistent with the methodology given in Module MARR and any technical guidance specified in the monitoring plan.
WRC
In projects with a WRC component, the information required to periodically reassess the project
baseline must include changes in the drainage layout and climate variables, as specified in
Module BL-PEAT or BL-TW and, where relevant, Modules BL-UP and BL-PL and any technical
guidance specified in the monitoring plan.
Carbon stocks in most cases will not have to be monitored during the baseline period, except in
the following cases:


Where there is an increased accuracy and precision of the ex-ante carbon stock
estimates, which are also used for ex-post calculations. Verifiable evidence must be
provided to VCS verifiers that the accuracy and precision of the carbon stock estimates
have improved, compared to previous estimates. Any change in carbon stock densities
will be subject to validation.



Where emissions reductions/removals are claimed for avoiding forest degradation
caused by extraction of wood for fuel or charcoal or carbon sequestration in forest land
that would have been deforested in the baseline case. In such cases, the methods
described in Module M-REDD.

Carbon stocks must be reassessed at every baseline revision.
Where emissions are included in the baseline, they must be monitored in the project case,
following the methodological procedures described in the emission modules (E-BPB, E-FFC, and
E-NA).
The calculations of actual carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions must be
reported using transparent procedures.
Changes in water depths in the project area (and leakage belt for unplanned deforestation), must
be measured before each verification as part of the monitoring. Methods must be consistent with
the methodology given in Module M-PEAT or M-TW and any technical guidance specified in the
monitoring plan.
Monitoring of Leakage
All significant sources of leakage identified are subject to monitoring, following the procedures
outlined in the monitoring plan. Such procedures must be consistent with the applicable leakage

REDD+MF - 52

modules (LK-ASP, LK-ASU, LK-ME, LK-DFW, LK-ARR and LK-ECO). All relevant parameters in
the leakage modules must be included in the monitoring plan.
TASK 2: Revising the Baseline for Future Project Crediting Periods
Baselines must be revised over time because agents, drivers and underlying causes of
deforestation as well as drainage layouts and climate variables change dynamically. The
methodological procedure used to update the baseline must be the same as used in the first
estimation.
